# security-jwt-implementation
This Json Web Token Authentication system is implemented using Spring Boot and Java. It was built in order to be used on uth-ece470 (University of Thessaly - Software Design & Development) final project. The project is a Health Managment System web app, and all the http requests that reach the server are processed by the Spring Boot Controllers. 
# How it works
The authorized urls are /api/v1/auth/register and /api/v1/auth/authenticate. The register/login page sends to the server a Json containing the credentials. The server generates a token and writes it on user's cookies (httpOnly & Secure so that they cannot be accessed/modified by JavaScript). The token comes along with every http request performed by the browser. The server is able to check if the token is valid/expired or not, and decide whether to let user access specific data or not.
